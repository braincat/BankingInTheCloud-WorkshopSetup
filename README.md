# BankingInTheCloud-WorkshopSetup
This repo gives general instructions for the BankingInTheCloud workshops we provide. 

## Where to start

If the workshop did not start yet then please follow the instructions in the [before-workshop folder](https://github.com/senacor/BankingInTheCloud-WorkshopSetup/tree/master/before-workshop).
If the workshop already started follow the instructions in the [during-workshop folder](https://github.com/senacor/BankingInTheCloud-WorkshopSetup/tree/master/during-workshop).

The before-workshop folder provides setup information using a virtual machine (using Vagrant). If you want to do the setup locally you can refer to the [alternative-setup folder](https://github.com/senacor/BankingInTheCloud-WorkshopSetup/tree/master/alternative-setup).

## Workshop Goal

After the workshop participants are able to work with the fineract project. They understand the basic concepts of microservices architectures and the tools that are necessary to work with them. After the workshop participants are able to explore the fineract project in depth on their own.   

Note that it depends on the workshop time and number of participants how much of the outline can really be done. The workshop is generally designed for five whole day, but can be shortened to two-four days. Workshops shorter than five days might not include the complete setup of fineract but a simpler example.
